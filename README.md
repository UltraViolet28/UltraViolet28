Hello there :wave:

I’m a Pre-Final Year Undergraduate Student in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Visvesvaraya National Institue of Technology, Nagpur, India. I'm quite passionate about Robotics and the Maths behind it. I believe that every problem in this world can be solved with the advancement of technology.

More about me:

:telescope: I'm an active member of IvLabs, a Robotics and AI Research Lab at VNIT, Nagpur. Checkout the interesting projects that my group and I are working on.
:speech_balloon: I have worked in the field of Mobile Robotics, particularly in the field of Localization, Multiview Geometry, Computer Vision and Sensor Fusion.
:smile: Currently, I am working in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning mainly on the problem statement of loop closure optimization. 
The main aim of the project is to implement representation learning to improve the backend of the pose graph for loop closure optimization. 
:mag: My current research lies in the field of Graph based algorithms for Localization and tightly coupled fusion of an IMU with that of camera providing Visual Odometry.
:stars: <!-- My goal is to build a fully autonomous robot from scratch. -->
